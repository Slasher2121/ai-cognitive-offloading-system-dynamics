# Model Structure

This system dynamics model represents the interaction between
AI-assisted cognitive offloading and long-term human capability formation.

## Stocks
- Deep Reading Capability
- AI Assisted Reading Usage

## Flows
- Effortful Reading Practice (inflow)
- Skill Atrophy (outflow)

## Converters
- Reflection Effort

## Feedback Loops

### B1: Capability–Atrophy Loop (Balancing)
As Deep Reading Capability increases, Skill Atrophy also increases,
which counteracts long-term growth in capability.

### B2: AI Usage–Reflection Loop (Balancing)
Higher AI Assisted Reading Usage reduces Reflection Effort,
which lowers Effortful Reading Practice, accelerating skill decay.

## Time Horizon
- Unit: Months
- Purpose: Observe long-run structural effects, not short-term performance
